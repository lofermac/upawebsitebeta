# Mock Login System - Testing Guide

## Overview
This is a frontend-only mock authentication system for testing UI/UX. No real backend is required.

## Test Credentials

### Admin Access
- **Username:** `admin`
- **Password:** `admin`
- **Redirects to:** `/admin/dashboard`

### Player Access
- **Username:** `player`
- **Password:** `player`
- **Redirects to:** `/player/dashboard`

### Invalid Credentials
- Any other combination will show: "Invalid credentials"

## Features Implemented

### 1. Login Page (`/login`)
- Modern dark theme design
- Username and password fields
- Error message display for invalid credentials
- Maintains existing design aesthetic
- All text in English

### 2. Admin Dashboard (`/admin/dashboard`)
- **Header:** "Admin Panel - Chris" with logout button
- **Sidebar Menu:**
  - Dashboard (chart icon)
  - Users (people icon)
  - Settings (gear icon)
  - Reports (document icon)
- **Main Content:**
  - Statistics cards (Total Users, Active Players, Revenue, Active Sessions)
  - Revenue overview chart (area chart)
  - Recent users table with mock data
- **Theme:** Dark with green (#10b981) accent color
- **Responsive:** Mobile-friendly with collapsible sidebar

### 3. Player Dashboard (`/player/dashboard`)
- **Header:** "My Dashboard - Player" with logout button
- **Sidebar Menu:**
  - Dashboard (home icon)
  - My Games (gamepad icon)
  - Statistics (chart icon)
  - Profile (user icon)
- **Main Content:**
  - Player statistics cards (Matches Played, Wins, Score, Ranking)
  - Performance trend chart (line chart)
  - Skills radar chart
  - Recent games table with results
- **Theme:** Consistent dark design with green accents
- **Responsive:** Mobile-friendly layout

### 4. Route Protection
- Unauthenticated users are redirected to `/login`
- Admin accessing player routes → redirected to `/admin/dashboard`
- Player accessing admin routes → redirected to `/player/dashboard`
- Session stored in localStorage
- Logout clears session and returns to login

## Testing Steps

1. **Start the development server:**
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

2. **Navigate to:** `http://localhost:3000/login`

3. **Test Admin Login:**
   - Username: `admin`
   - Password: `admin`
   - Should redirect to Admin Dashboard
   - Verify all sidebar navigation works
   - Check stats cards and charts display
   - Test logout functionality

4. **Test Player Login:**
   - Username: `player`
   - Password: `player`
   - Should redirect to Player Dashboard
   - Verify sidebar navigation
   - Check statistics and game history
   - Test logout

5. **Test Invalid Credentials:**
   - Try any other username/password combination
   - Should show "Invalid credentials" error

6. **Test Route Protection:**
   - Try accessing `/admin/dashboard` without logging in
   - Try accessing `/player/dashboard` without logging in
   - Should redirect to login page

7. **Test Cross-Access Prevention:**
   - Login as admin
   - Manually navigate to `/player/dashboard`
   - Should redirect back to admin dashboard
   - Vice versa for player accessing admin routes
